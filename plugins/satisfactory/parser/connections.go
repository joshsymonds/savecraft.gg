// instance paths (the owning machine/belt/splitter/etc.), transport is "belt"
// or "pipe". Both ends of a physical link emit a mirror edge, so line
// connectivity treats from/to symmetrically (union-find unions both).
//
// directed is set when the owning connector names its flow side — an "Output"
// connector means flow leaves the owner (from=owner→to=connected), an "Input"
// connector means flow enters it (from=connected→to=owner). Belt-side
// "ConveyorAny" connectors and pipe connectors carry no side, so directed is
// false (connectivity still holds). The flow side comes from the connector
// instance-name suffix, not the mDirection property — that property is
// inconsistently serialized across saves.
